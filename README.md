# Teensy4.1-SdFat
Sketch to record micros() and data from 2 analog inputs (10,000 samples/second each).

I've been using Teensy3.6 with SdFat and had some fantastic results.  When I heard PJRC had released the Teensy4.1, I bought one immediately.

I'm new to Github and I have VERY little experience with programming, but I was able to throw this together and I thought I'd share it here.

I'm working to reduce the lag associated with "dumping" data to the SD card.  I'd appreciate any help to acheive this goal.

Thank you PJRC and Greiman!
